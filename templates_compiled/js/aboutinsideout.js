Everyone is challenged to use black and white photographic portraits to discover, reveal and share the untold stories and images of people around the world. These digitally uploaded images will be made into posters and sent back to the project’s co-creators for them to exhibit in their own communities. People can participate as an individual or in a group; posters can be placed anywhere, from a solitary image in an office window to a wall of portraits on an abandoned building or a full stadium. These exhibitions are documented, archived and viewable virtually.<br>\n<img id="work" src="img/IMG_5351_INSIDEOUT.png">\n\nGigantic Photobooths are also being installed everywhere in the world (Paris - Centre Pompidou, Arles, etc)\n<img id="work" src="img/PompidouIMG_6315.png">\n\n</p>\n\n<img src="img/pointpetit.png">\n\n\n<h2 id="soustitre"><img src="img/picto-rectangle.png">&nbsp;GET INVOLVED</h2>\n\n\n<h3 id="question"><img src="img/picto-triangle.png">&nbsp;Want to organize a group action? </h3>\n\n<p id="p">\nIf you are interested in participating in INSIDE OUT as a group or community, please contact us via email: jr@insideoutproject.net <br> \nPlease put your location and GROUP ACTION in the subject line.
